# Project Guidelines

## Memory Updates

After completing every task, update the auto memory files in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-adarsh-myProjects-pl-odds-pl-odds/memory/` with key learnings, patterns, and insights from the work done. Keep MEMORY.md concise and link to topic-specific files for details.
